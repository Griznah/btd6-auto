# BTD6 Automation Bot - Project Idea

## Overview
Create a Python3-based automation bot for Bloons Tower Defense 6 (BTD6), a popular tower defense game. The bot will automate gameplay actions, supporting both Linux and Windows platforms.

## Goals
- Automate core gameplay tasks (placing towers, upgrading, using abilities).
- Support multiple heroes, towers, and maps.
- Modular design for easy extension and testing.
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux & Windows).

## Stages of Development

### Stage 1: Research & Planning
- Identify automation methods (screen reading, input simulation).
- List supported heroes, towers, and maps.
- Define minimum viable product (MVP) features.

### Stage 2: Environment Setup
- Set up Python3 project structure.
- Choose libraries for GUI automation (e.g., pyautogui, opencv).
- Ensure cross-platform support.

### Stage 3: Basic Automation
- Implement screen capture and input simulation.
- Automate simple actions (start game, place basic towers).

### Stage 4: Advanced Features
- Add support for hero selection and abilities.
- Implement tower upgrades and map-specific strategies.
- Add error handling and logging.

### Stage 5: Testing & Optimization
- Test on Linux and Windows.
- Optimize for speed and reliability.
- Gather feedback and iterate.

## Technical Considerations
- Use pyautogui for mouse/keyboard automation.
- Use opencv for image recognition (detecting game state).
- Modular codebase for easy updates.
- Configuration files for user preferences.

## Future Ideas
- GUI for bot configuration.
- Strategy profiles for different maps/modes.
- Community plugin system.
